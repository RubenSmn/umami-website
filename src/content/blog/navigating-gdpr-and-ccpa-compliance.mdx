## The Importance of Cookie-Free Analytics for Marketers

Marketers understand the importance of accurate website visitor data in determining whether marketing campaigns work. However, with the growing concern around online privacy, it's crucial to gather this data while respecting visitors' privacy.

The challenge for marketers is to balance respecting user privacy, complying with laws and regulations, and getting work done. Regardless of the privacy landscape, marketers must still move the needle and produce results.

This article gives marketers a high-level overview of what they need to know about GDPR and CCPA, using cookie-free analytics to respect users' privacy and still having the data they need to do their jobs.

## The Importance of Compliance

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have set the standard for website analytics, making compliance with these privacy laws a non-negotiable for marketers. Ensuring your website analytics align with these regulations is crucial. It's not just important; it's a cornerstone of your marketing strategy because users expect privacy. California and Europe are also huge markets that marketers want to tap into to drive awareness, leads, etc.

With cookie-free website analytics like Umami, which is GDPR and CCPA compliant by default, you can gather anonymized visitor data in your Umami dashboard without storing personal information on their devices (e.g., a cookie), a critical step towards compliance. Umami is cookie-free and GDPR and CCPA-compliant by default, ensuring you respect data privacy by anonymizing all data and never collecting personal information.

It's important to note that with Umami, you can still track the success of marketing campaigns. It is a misconception that cookie-free website analytics means no attribution. This couldn't be further from the truth.

## Privacy-Focused Analytics as a Marketing Tool

Privacy-focused website analytics isn't just a legal requirement; it's a powerful tool for marketers. It's a tangible way to show respect for visitors' privacy and dedication to transparency, ensure compliance, and build trust with visitors. By offering them the choice to opt out of data collection, you're demonstrating your commitment to a user-centric approach to data collection.

Umami enables you to own your data, giving you control and ensuring compliance with ever-changing privacy laws. This fosters trust and loyalty among your visitors. Since Umami is cookie-free, you don't have to display an opt-in/opt-out cookie banner.

## GDPR Compliance

GDPR compliance is essential for marketers who target visitors in the European Union. When website visitors consent to collect their data, you can ensure you comply with GDPR. This means informing visitors about the data you collect, how you use it, and how long you store it. Visitors must also be given the option to opt out of data collection.

## CCPA Compliance

CCPA compliance is also necessary for marketers targeting California visitors. By complying with the CCPA, you give California residents the right to:

1. Know what personal information is collected.
2. Request the data collected on them be deleted.
3. Opt out of selling their data.

All data from Umami website analytics is anonymized, and no personal data is ever collected. By default, you are in compliance with both GDPR and CCPA.

## Marketing Attribution

With Umami, you can comply with GDPR and CCPA and still track the success of your marketing campaigns.
